# Bachelor thesis 

## Final thesis for Bachelor Degree in Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics at University of Trieste year 2023/2024

In this thesis different use of machine learning algorithms are explored to detect cheaters in online video games. Traditional anti-cheat methods struggle to keep up with the evolution of exploits strategies, this make AI driven approaches an interesting alternative. The paper analyzes a multivariate time series dataset from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, applying model like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Isolation Forest and Neural Networks to classify player behavior. The results highlight the potential of machine learning in identifying cheaters, with neural network resulting as the most effective used methods.
